                    Cookie number density as measured by Cookie Monster during
                    flight. This value is extrapolated to the entire cabin but
                    is a discreet measurement of cookies/seat during flight.
                    There is inherent uncertainty in the measurement as cookies
                    are eaten in flight while being counted.

-   VARIABLE_NAME:  COOKIE_UNC
    SCALE_FACTOR: 1

    VARIABLE_DESC: Uncertainty in count

           
SPECIAL_COMMENTS:   >
                    A significant number of cookies were eaten during the flight 
                    so the uncertainty is larger than usual.
